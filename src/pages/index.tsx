                    <h1>What is mindful eating?</h1>
                    <p>Mindful eating is maintaining an in-the-moment awareness of the food and drink you put into your body. It
                        involves observing how the food makes you feel and the signals your body sends about taste,
                        satisfaction,
                        and fullness. Mindful eating requires you to simply acknowledge and accept rather than judge the
                        feepngs,
                        thoughts, and bodily sensations you observe. It can extend to the process of buying, preparing, and
                        serving
                        your food as well as consuming it.</p>
                    <p>Mindful eating isn't about being perfect, always eating the right things, or never allowing yourself to
                        eat
                        on-the-go again. And it's not about estabpshing strict rules for how many calories you can eat or which
                        foods you have to include or avoid in your diet. Rather, it's about focusing all your senses and being
                        present as you shop for, cook, serve, and eat your food.</p>
                    <p>While mindfulness isn't for everyone, many people find that by eating this way, even for just a few meals
                        a
                        week, you can become more attuned to your body. This can help you to avoid overeating, make it easier to
                        change your dietary habits for the better, and enjoy the improved well-being that comes with a healthier
                        diet.</p>

                    <p>How you eat your food is as equally important as what type of foods you eat when it comes to regulating

                        weight. </p>
